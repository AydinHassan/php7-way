Write a program that adds the numbers 1 and 2 and prints the result twice.

You must use 2 functions that take the numbers as arguments.
You must name your functions "noStrictFunction" and "strictFunction".

The "noStrictFunction" must use the scalar type hint "int" for the 2 arguments whereas the "strictFunction" must not.

Your output must be as following:
firstResult
secondResult

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

You can use "echo" to print the result.

To jump from one line to another, you can use "\n".

Documentation on the `scalar type declarations` can be found by pointing your browser here:
