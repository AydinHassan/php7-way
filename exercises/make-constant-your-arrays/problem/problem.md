Write a program that prints the third command-line argument.
You must write this program using constant arrays by defining a constant for the `argv` array before using it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

You can define a constant for an array as following:
```php
define('ITEMS', ['item1', 'item2', 'item3']);
```

Then you can use it as following for instance:
```php
var_dump(ITEMS);
```

Documentation on constant arrays can be found by pointing your browser here:
